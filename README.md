The app is developed in JavaScript using [React](https://reactjs.org/) as UI framework.

To try the app just run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies and then `yarn dev` to start the development server.
It will automatically open your default browser at `localhost:8080`.



To run the unit tests just run `yarn test`. Tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
